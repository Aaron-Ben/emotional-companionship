"""Character data models - Simplified for file system based storage.

Characters are stored as:
- data/characters/{uuid}/prompt.md - Character system prompt
- data/characters/{uuid}/daily/ - Diary files
- data/characters/{uuid}/chat/ - Chat history

Each character has:
- character_id: UUID4 (also used as directory name)
- name: Display name (from prompt.md first line)
- created_at: Creation timestamp (from directory mtime)
